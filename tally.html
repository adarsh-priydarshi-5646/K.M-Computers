                    <li><strong>Double Entry System:</strong>
                        <p>Tally uses the double-entry system of accounting, which means every transaction is recorded in two accounts—debit and credit. This ensures accuracy and balance in financial reporting.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Ledgers and Vouchers:</strong>

                    <li><strong>Trial Balance:</strong>
                        <p>The trial balance is a summary of all ledger balances, used to check the correctness of the books by ensuring that the sum of debits equals the sum of credits.</p>
